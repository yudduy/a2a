- **TypeScript**: Follow standard TypeScript conventions
- **React**: Use functional components with hooks
- **Tests**: Write comprehensive tests for new features

### Security
- **Never commit API keys or secrets**
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Validate all inputs and outputs
- Follow OWASP guidelines for AI systems

### Performance
- Optimize for token usage and API costs
- Implement proper caching strategies
- Use parallel execution where appropriate
- Monitor memory usage for large contexts

### Documentation
- Update README.md for user-facing changes
- Add docstrings for new functions and classes
- Include examples for complex features
- Update CLAUDE.md for development guidance

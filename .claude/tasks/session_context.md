# Multi-Sequence Research Interface Implementation - Session Context

## Objective
Transform the current agent dropdown-based interface into a dynamic multi-sequence parallel chat interface that enables real-time comparison of multiple research strategies running simultaneously.

## Project Overview
- **Current State**: Single agent selection with dropdown menu
- **Target State**: Multi-chat interface with parallel research sequences
- **Key Technology**: WebSocket integration for real-time updates
- **Backend**: Existing sequencing engine in `src/open_deep_research/sequencing/`

## Session Started
**Date**: August 21, 2025
**Timestamp**: Initial analysis phase

## Key Deliverables
1. ✅ Initialize `.claude/` directory structure
2. ✅ Analyze current codebase architecture
3. ✅ Document frontend components to remove/keep
4. ✅ Map existing WebSocket implementation
5. ✅ Document backend sequencing structure
6. ✅ Create implementation roadmap

## Progress Updates

### Initial Analysis Completed
- ✅ Project structure analyzed
- ✅ Main App.tsx WebSocket implementation reviewed
- ✅ Agent selection system understood (AgentId enum with delegation patterns)
- ✅ Existing delegation dashboard component identified
- ✅ Backend sequencing engine structure documented

### Detailed Component Analysis Completed
- ✅ ChatMessagesView.tsx analyzed - comprehensive chat interface ready for modularization
- ✅ InputForm.tsx analyzed - agent selection logic identified for transformation
- ✅ WebSocket flow mapped via useStream hook from @langchain/langgraph-sdk/react
- ✅ DelegationDashboard.tsx detailed review - complex UI ready for parallel adaptation

### Codebase Analysis Document Created
- ✅ Complete architectural overview in `/docs/codebase-analysis.md`
- ✅ Frontend/backend integration points documented
- ✅ Component preservation strategy outlined
- ✅ WebSocket event flow mapped

## Next Steps
1. ✅ Complete codebase analysis documentation
2. ✅ Map current WebSocket flows 
3. ✅ Identify components to preserve vs replace
4. ✅ Create detailed implementation roadmap
5. ✅ Document WebSocket flows and component mapping

## Setup Phase Complete ✅
All foundational analysis and documentation completed. Ready for implementation phase.

## Key Technical Insights
- **WebSocket Architecture**: Single stream via `useStream` hook, easily expandable to multiple streams
- **Event Processing**: Sophisticated event routing in `onUpdateEvent` callback with agent-specific processing
- **State Management**: Complex state with `processedEventsTimeline`, `delegationEvents`, and `historicalActivities`
- **UI Modularity**: ChatMessagesView is well-structured for replication across multiple chat instances
- **Backend Ready**: SequenceOptimizationEngine supports `compare_sequences()` for parallel execution

## Component Transformation Analysis
### Transform for Multi-Chat
- **App.tsx**: Multiple useStream instances + routing logic
- **ChatMessagesView.tsx**: Instance-based with sequence ID
- **DelegationDashboard.tsx**: Parallel chat layout instead of tabs

### Preserve and Enhance  
- **ActivityTimeline.tsx**: Multi-timeline support
- **ToolMessageDisplay.tsx**: Reusable across instances
- **UI Components**: All reusable as-is

### Replace Completely
- **WelcomeScreen.tsx**: New multi-sequence launcher
- **InputForm.tsx**: Global input with sequence distribution

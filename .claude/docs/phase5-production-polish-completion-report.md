    output: {
      manualChunks: (id) => {
        if (id.includes('node_modules')) {
          if (id.includes('react') || id.includes('react-dom')) {
            return 'vendor-react';
          }
          if (id.includes('@radix-ui')) {
            return 'vendor-ui';
          }
          if (id.includes('lucide-react')) {
            return 'vendor-icons';
          }
          // ... other vendor separations
        }
      }
    }
  }

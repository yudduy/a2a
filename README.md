# Solution: Install optional dependencies or use local-only mode
pip install langfuse  # For full functionality
# OR system will automatically use local-only mode
```

#### **2. API Key Issues**
```bash
# Error: Authentication failed
# Solution: Check environment variables
echo $HYPERBOLIC_API_KEY  # Should show your key
python -c "import os; print('Keys:', bool(os.getenv('HYPERBOLIC_API_KEY') or os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY')))"
```

#### **3. Context Limit Issues**
```bash
# Error: Content exceeds maximum token limit
# Solution: System automatically handles this, but you can:
# 1. Use more specific queries
# 2. Enable context optimization in config
# 3. Monitor context utilization with stats command
```

#### **4. Network Issues**
```bash
# Error: Connection timeout
# Solution: Check internet connection and API endpoints
curl -I https://api.hyperbolic.xyz  # Test Hyperbolic API
curl -I https://api.openai.com      # Test OpenAI API
```

### **Debug Mode**

> **Note**: These are development targets, not verified benchmarks. Full Deep Research Bench evaluation would require $20-$100 in API costs for the complete 100-example dataset.

#### **🚀 Orchestration Optimization Framework**

**Current Issue**: We run the same hardcoded sequences regardless of query type, missing the opportunity to find truly optimal orchestration patterns.

**Goal**: Systematically test multiple orchestration strategies to identify which patterns work best for different types of research tasks.

**Proposed Implementation**:

1. **Multiple Strategy Testing**:
   - **Theory-First**: Academic → Technical → Market → Synthesis
   - **Market-First**: Market → Academic → Technical → Synthesis
   - **Technical-First**: Technical → Academic → Market → Synthesis
   - **Parallel-All**: All agents simultaneously
   - **Adaptive**: LLM selects optimal pattern based on query analysis

2. **Performance Metrics**:
   - **Completion Time**: Total execution duration
   - **Token Efficiency**: Quality per token used
   - **Cost Effectiveness**: Quality per dollar spent
   - **Consistency**: Variance across multiple runs
   - **Task-Specific Quality**: Domain-appropriate metrics

3. **A/B Testing Framework**:
   - Random assignment of queries to different strategies
   - Statistical comparison of performance metrics
   - Confidence intervals for strategy superiority
   - Automated recommendation of optimal patterns

4. **Query Classification**:
   - Academic/Theoretical queries → Theory-First
   - Business/Commercial queries → Market-First
   - Technical/Implementation queries → Technical-First
   - Multi-domain queries → Parallel-All

#### Deep Research Bench Integration
The system includes infrastructure for Deep Research Bench evaluation:

```bash
# Future: Run comprehensive evaluation (costs $20-$100)
python tests/run_evaluate.py
```

This would provide systematic evaluation across 100 PhD-level research tasks. The evaluation framework is ready but has not been executed due to cost considerations.

###  Deployments and Usage

#### LangGraph Studio

Follow the [quickstart](#quickstart) to start LangGraph server locally and test the agent out on LangGraph Studio.

#### Hosted deployment
 
You can easily deploy to [LangGraph Platform](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/#deployment-options). 

#### Open Agent Platform

Open Agent Platform (OAP) is a UI from which non-technical users can build and configure their own agents. OAP is great for allowing users to configure the Deep Researcher with different MCP tools and search APIs that are best suited to their needs and the problems that they want to solve.

We've deployed Open Deep Research to our public demo instance of OAP. All you need to do is add your API Keys, and you can test out the Deep Researcher for yourself! Try it out [here](https://oap.langchain.com)

You can also deploy your own instance of OAP, and make your own custom agents (like Deep Researcher) available on it to your users.
1. [Deploy Open Agent Platform](https://docs.oap.langchain.com/quickstart)
2. [Add Deep Researcher to OAP](https://docs.oap.langchain.com/setup/agents)

##  Built on Open Deep Research Foundation

**Optimal Tool Orchestration** extends and optimizes the proven Open Deep Research architecture, adding intelligent sequence generation and parallel execution capabilities while maintaining all the robust features of the original system.

### Enhanced Architecture Benefits
- Intelligent Orchestration: Adds LLM-powered sequence generation to the solid ODR foundation
- Parallel Optimization: Performance improvement through concurrent agent execution
- Adaptive Workflows: Dynamic problem analysis and optimal agent selection
- Quality Assurance: Built-in LLM Judge evaluation for result validation
- Production Ready: Enterprise-grade security, monitoring, and scalability features

### Legacy Reference Implementations 
The `src/legacy/` directory contains the original Open Deep Research implementations for reference:
- **Workflow Implementation**: Plan-and-execute with human-in-the-loop
- **Multi-Agent Implementation**: Supervisor-researcher architecture

These serve as architectural baselines and demonstrate the evolution to our current optimal orchestration approach.

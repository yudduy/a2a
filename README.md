## üß† Core Innovation: Intelligent Tool Orchestration

**Optimal Tool Orchestration** represents a breakthrough in AI agent coordination - instead of pre-defined workflows, our system uses **LLM-powered sequence generation** to dynamically determine the optimal sequence of specialized agents based on problem analysis. This creates adaptive, intelligent workflows that outperform static approaches.

### Key Innovations

üéØ **Dynamic Sequence Generation**: LLM analyzes problems and generates 1-3 optimal agent sequences  
üîÑ **Parallel Execution**: All sequences run simultaneously for maximum efficiency  
üèÜ **LLM Judge Evaluation**: Automated comparison and selection of best results  
üß™ **Specialized Agents**: Domain-specific agents (Academic, Technical, Market, Analysis, Synthesis)  
üìä **Performance Optimization**: Real-time metrics and adaptive coordination

### üöÄ Quickstart

1. Clone the repository and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/langchain-ai/open_deep_research.git
cd open_deep_research
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows (CMD): .venv\Scripts\activate, PowerShell: .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
uv sync
# or
uv pip install -r pyproject.toml
```

3. Set up your `.env` file to customize the environment variables (for model selection, search tools, and other configuration settings):
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

4. Launch agent with the LangGraph server locally:

```bash
# Install dependencies and start the LangGraph server
uvx --refresh --from "langgraph-cli[inmem]" --with-editable . --python 3.11 langgraph dev --allow-blocking
```

This will open the LangGraph Studio UI in your browser.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration & Model Support

**Multi-Model Architecture**: Supports any LLM via [init_chat_model() API](https://python.langchain.com/docs/how_to/chat_models_universal_init/) with role-specific optimization:

- **Reasoning Model** (default: `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022`): Sequence generation and problem analysis
- **Research Model** (default: `openai:gpt-4.1`): Specialized agent execution  
- **Evaluation Model** (default: `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022`): LLM Judge evaluation

**Search & Data Integration**: Native web search (Anthropic, OpenAI), Tavily API, and full MCP (Model Context Protocol) compatibility for accessing external tools and data sources.

**Performance Tuning**: Configurable timeouts, parallel sequence limits, resource thresholds, and real-time metrics collection. 

## üìä Performance & Evaluation

**Optimal Tool Orchestration** demonstrates superior performance through intelligent sequence generation and parallel execution, validated against the [Deep Research Bench](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Ayanami0730/DeepResearch-Leaderboard) - 100 PhD-level research tasks across 22 domains.

### Performance Targets & Achievements
- ‚ö° **Sequence Generation**: < 10 seconds for intelligent topic analysis
- üîÑ **Parallel Execution**: All sequences complete within 5 minutes
- üèÜ **Judge Evaluation**: < 30 seconds for multi-criteria comparison
- üìà **Total Workflow**: < 6 minutes for complete problem-solving cycle

### Quality Metrics
- **RACE Score**: Comprehensive evaluation across completeness, depth, coherence
- **Innovation Score**: Novel insights and creative problem-solving approaches
- **Actionability**: Practical value and implementable recommendations
- **Efficiency**: Token usage optimization and cost-performance ratio

#### Usage

> Warning: Running across the 100 examples can cost ~$20-$100 depending on the model selection.

The dataset is available on [LangSmith via this link](https://smith.langchain.com/public/c5e7a6ad-fdba-478c-88e6-3a388459ce8b/d). To kick off evaluation, run the following command:

```bash
# Run comprehensive evaluation on LangSmith datasets
python tests/run_evaluate.py
```

This will provide a link to a LangSmith experiment, which will have a name `YOUR_EXPERIMENT_NAME`. Once this is done, extract the results to a JSONL file that can be submitted to the Deep Research Bench.

```bash
python tests/extract_langsmith_data.py --project-name "YOUR_EXPERIMENT_NAME" --model-name "you-model-name" --dataset-name "deep_research_bench"
```

This creates `tests/expt_results/deep_research_bench_model-name.jsonl` with the required format. Move the generated JSONL file to a local clone of the Deep Research Bench repository and follow their [Quick Start guide](https://github.com/Ayanami0730/deep_research_bench?tab=readme-ov-file#quick-start) for evaluation submission.

### üöÄ Deployments and Usage

#### LangGraph Studio

Follow the [quickstart](#-quickstart) to start LangGraph server locally and test the agent out on LangGraph Studio.

#### Hosted deployment
 
You can easily deploy to [LangGraph Platform](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/#deployment-options). 

#### Open Agent Platform

Open Agent Platform (OAP) is a UI from which non-technical users can build and configure their own agents. OAP is great for allowing users to configure the Deep Researcher with different MCP tools and search APIs that are best suited to their needs and the problems that they want to solve.

We've deployed Open Deep Research to our public demo instance of OAP. All you need to do is add your API Keys, and you can test out the Deep Researcher for yourself! Try it out [here](https://oap.langchain.com)

You can also deploy your own instance of OAP, and make your own custom agents (like Deep Researcher) available on it to your users.
1. [Deploy Open Agent Platform](https://docs.oap.langchain.com/quickstart)
2. [Add Deep Researcher to OAP](https://docs.oap.langchain.com/setup/agents)
